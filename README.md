The purpose of this research/paper is to highlight the details of the various techniques involved in the computation of the
skyline queries. The skyline queries have been popular in users who have multiple preferences on the various
dimensions of the data. The skyline or Pareto operator selects tuples from a relation which are not dominated by the
others. Although the concept of skyline computation originated from the centralized database environment, as the
application needs grew, the concept has been applied successfully to modern computational environments like
distributed networks, real time systems, mobile ad hoc networks etc. However, even in modern computing
environments, the basic algorithms have been applied in their original or extended forms. This paper puts the focus
on the various skyline computing algorithms related to the centralized computing environment and presents a
summary that is useful for getting the guidelines for developing an altogether new skyline computation algorithm
related to centralized or modern computing environments.
